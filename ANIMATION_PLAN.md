# octopus-mma Animation Master Plan

Everything that needs a `.poses.json` file + Blender pose asset + muscle highlights.
Organized by priority: what octopus-health needs first, then MMA depth.

---

## FORMAT REFERENCE

**Pose files are format v2, a rigid skeleton. Read `docs/POSES.md`; the engine is
`lib/stick-figure.js` and `validate()` in it is the rule book.** A frame stores the ANGLE of
each body segment (fixed bone lengths), never joint coordinates, so a limb cannot detach or
stretch. The old per-joint percentage format (`head, neck, spine, shoulderL/R, ...` with
x/y per joint, and `opponentJoints`) is gone: do not author in it. A second body for grappling
is the `partner` block described in the doc.

Each `.poses.json` sits next to its `.md`. Check with `node scripts/poses.mjs` and LOOK at
`node scripts/poses.mjs --sheet out.png <slug>`. `test/poses.test.js` runs every file through
the rules and fails if a technique page has no valid animation.

Highlights are v2 names (`kneeL`, `hand`, `spine`, `ankleR`...), which the renderer colours red
on that frame. Blender pose assets still carry `hl_color_1..6` custom props for the
ecorche muscle highlight (see below); that is separate from the 2D figure.

Orthodox stance = right-handed fighter facing right; `L` is the lead (near) side, `R` the rear.

### Known approximations (2D side view)

- Hooks, slips and weaves move across the body; shown as lean, dip and elbow height.
- Side kick and roundhouse: the hip turn is shown as backward lean and leg height, not a turn.
- TKD back stance and attention stance: the 90-degree rear foot and the V of the feet point
  toward the camera and are not drawn.
- Side control is shown chest-on-chest (the real position is a perpendicular T, unreadable from
  the side). Armbar and triangle overlap the two bodies more than a photo would.
- Techniques without a page yet (back kick, axe kick, poomsae) have no pose; add the page, then the pose.

## BLENDER STATUS (as of 2026-05-30)

**File:** `~/Documents/Octopus MMA/mmaCurrent5-13-bak.blend`
**Model:** `male_ecorche` — imported, rig connected, texture NOT applied (pink = no texture)
**Highlight system:** `Ecorche_Highlight` material exists with 6 color slots, drivers on rig props `hl_color_1..6`
**Script:** `~/blender-scripts/setup_highlights.py` — idempotent, safe to re-run

### IMMEDIATE BLENDER TASKS (do before animating more)

**Task 1 — Reapply texture:**
1. Select `male_ecorche` mesh
2. Open Shader Editor
3. Find `Ecorche_Highlight` material → find the `ShaderNodeTexImage` node
4. If image slot is empty: click the image dropdown → navigate to:
   `~/Documents/Octopus MMA/Ecorche_Musclenames_Female_and_Male_Anatomy(1)/diffuse.jpeg`
5. Switch viewport to Material Preview (3rd sphere icon) — should show the labeled anatomy texture

**Task 2 — Verify highlight system:**
1. Select `rig` → N-panel → Item → Custom Properties
2. Drag `hl_color_1` to a bright hot-pink (not black)
3. In Material Preview, some region of the écorché should turn red
4. If nothing turns red: run `~/blender-scripts/setup_highlights.py` in the Scripting workspace
5. TOLERANCE may need raising to 0.15+ (texture has shading variation per region)

**Task 3 — Muscle color sampling (MUSCLE_COLORS dict):**
The texture uses ~8 hue families. Sample each with the eyedropper in Blender's color picker.
Known families from handoff:
- Salmon-pink: PM (pectoralis major), D (deltoid), LD (latissimus dorsi), GMa (gluteus maximus), Tr (trapezius)
- Hot magenta: RA (rectus abdominis)
- Dark purple: EO (external oblique)
- Blue: BB (biceps brachii), VL (vastus lateralis), S (sartorius)
- Green: RF (rectus femoris), VM (vastus medialis), TFL (tensor fasciae latae), GMe (gluteus medius)
- Lavender: BF (biceps femoris), Ga (gastrocnemius), AM (adductor magnus)
- Yellow-sand: bones

## MUSCLE GROUP MAP (for hl_color slots → pose highlights)

Use 6 slots as logical groups, not per-muscle. Assign per-pose based on primary movers.

| Slot | Group | Key muscles | Texture color family |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| hl_color_1 | Push / Chest+Shoulder | PM, D (anterior), Tr (upper) | salmon-pink |
| hl_color_2 | Pull / Back | LD, Tr (mid-lower), rhomboids | salmon-pink (LD section) |
| hl_color_3 | Core / Abs | RA, EO, IO | hot magenta + dark purple |
| hl_color_4 | Hip / Glutes | GMa, GMe, TFL | salmon-pink + green |
| hl_color_5 | Legs | RF, VM, VL, BF, Ga, S, AM | blue + green + lavender |
| hl_color_6 | Arms | BB, TB (triceps brachii), BR (brachioradialis) | blue + (sample triceps) |

## BLENDER POSE ASSET WORKFLOW (per animation)

1. Apply pose to `rig` in the working .blend
2. Set `hl_color_1..6` custom props for the primary muscle groups engaged
   (use MUSCLE_COLORS dict once populated — see Task 3 above)
3. In the Asset Browser: Mark as Asset, name it, assign to correct catalog
4. **Critical:** In the Asset Browser → Asset Details → check "Include Custom Properties"
   so `hl_color_*` values save with the pose and restore on application
5. Save the .blend
6. Back up: File → External Data → Pack All Into .blend

## poses.json WORKFLOW (per animation)

1. Sketch keyframes using approximate joint coordinates (0–100 canvas)
2. Check in `content/<discipline>/<belt-or-level>/<slug>.poses.json`
3. Add matching `<slug>.md` with title, description, muscles used
4. Test in the Next.js dev server (the StickFigure component reads poses.json live)

---

## SCRIPT REWRITE PLAN (muscle selection was broken)

The old `yay.py` had selection issues. New approach:

**Problem:** Previous script tried to select mesh faces by material index, but the écorché
uses a single material with vertex-painted regions, not separate material slots per muscle.
The "selection" therefore selected nothing or the whole mesh.

**Correct approach:**
1. The écorché has UV-mapped regions that correspond to texture color areas.
2. To "select" a muscle group: select faces by UV island → those UVs map to the color region
   in diffuse.jpeg.
3. Better: don't select faces at all for highlighting — the highlight shader already does it
   by color-distance on the texture. The highlight system IS the selection system.
4. What was actually broken: `hl_color_*` were set to (0,0,0) so nothing matched.
   Solution: sample the correct RGB from diffuse.jpeg for each muscle group and store in
   the MUSCLE_COLORS dict.

**Revised script plan** (`~/blender-scripts/setup_muscle_colors.py`):
```python
# Samples pixel colors from diffuse.jpeg at known UV coordinates for each muscle group.
# Stores in a dict, then provides highlight(muscle_codes) helper.
import bpy, numpy as np
from PIL import Image

DIFFUSE_PATH = "~/Documents/Octopus MMA/Ecorche_Musclenames_Female_and_Male_Anatomy(1)/diffuse.jpeg"

# Known approximate UV center coordinates (u, v) for each labeled region
# These need to be measured from the texture — open diffuse.jpeg and sample
MUSCLE_UV = {
    "RA":  (0.50, 0.35),  # rectus abdominis — center chest/belly
    "EO":  (0.45, 0.40),  # external oblique — sides
    "PM":  (0.52, 0.28),  # pectoralis major
    "D":   (0.58, 0.25),  # deltoid
    "LD":  (0.40, 0.38),  # latissimus dorsi
    "Tr":  (0.50, 0.22),  # trapezius
    "BB":  (0.62, 0.32),  # biceps brachii
    "TB":  (0.58, 0.32),  # triceps brachii
    "RF":  (0.52, 0.58),  # rectus femoris
    "VM":  (0.54, 0.62),  # vastus medialis
    "VL":  (0.58, 0.60),  # vastus lateralis
    "BF":  (0.44, 0.62),  # biceps femoris
    "GMa": (0.46, 0.52),  # gluteus maximus
    "GMe": (0.50, 0.50),  # gluteus medius
    "Ga":  (0.52, 0.78),  # gastrocnemius
    "TFL": (0.56, 0.54),  # tensor fasciae latae
}
```

The UV coordinates above are approximate — they need eyedropper sampling in Blender's
Image Editor to get exact values. But the approach is correct.

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ORDER

1. 🔴 **Fix texture** (Task 1 above — 5 min)
2. 🔴 **Verify highlight shader** (Task 2 — 10 min)
3. 🟡 **Sample muscle colors** (Task 3 — 30–60 min, can be done in sessions)
4. 🟢 **Stretches** (content/stretching/ — needed for octopus-health daily workout DMs)
5. 🟢 **Exercises** (content/exercises/ — same)
6. 🔵 **Muay Thai** (deepest backlog, most content needed)
7. 🔵 **BJJ blue belt** (grappling depth)
8. ⚪ **Wrestling** (lower priority but completes MMA picture)

Total estimated animations needed: ~120 files
Currently done: ~32 files
Remaining: ~88 files
