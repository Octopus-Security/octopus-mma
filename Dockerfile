# Strip npm from the runtime image. Nothing here runs it — the CMD is a bare
# `node` — but Trivy reports what is PRESENT, not what is reachable, and npm
# bundles its own vulnerable tree: tar 7.5.11 (CVE-2026-59873, CRITICAL),
# pacote, sigstore, brace-expansion, picomatch, ip-address. Measured against
# node:22-alpine on 2026-09-21: 1 CRITICAL / 12 HIGH with npm, 0 / 2 without —
# 11 of those 13 findings were npm's, not Alpine's.
#
# Must run as root, so it goes above any USER line. octopus-cortex is the one
# service that keeps npm: its CVE checker shells out to `npm audit`.
# Guarded by octopus-vault/scripts/check-no-npm.mjs.
